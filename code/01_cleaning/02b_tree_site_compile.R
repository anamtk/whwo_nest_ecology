# Point-level tree and snag data
# Ana Miller-ter Kuile
# October 29, 2021

# this script combines the tree and snag data into
# summary datasets by survey point

# Steps in this script:
# 1. Figure out the total area of each transect and convert counts to 
# densities (MIS transects are wonky)

# 2. Convert Stage5 large tree DBH (actually Diameter at base) to DBH and 
 # remove those that would not be part of survey
## from Todd's code # PIPO (DBH): y = 0.880x - 3.807, R2 = 0.95, n = 328 (use also for PICO)
## # PSME/PSMEG (DBH): y = 0.853x - 0.996, R2 = 0.94, n = 294 (also use for ABCO and ABGR)

# 3. Remove stage 5 trees from "post" and "never_treated" sites

# 4. Subset snags > 23 (or 25?) cm

# 5. Create a final dataset of survey point and year, total small, med, 
# large and snag densities

# 6. Determine %PIPO for each plot (all trees > 25cm)

# Load packages -----------------------------------------------------------
